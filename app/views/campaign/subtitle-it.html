<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The problem</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Subtitles are available on most TV shows and films when broadcast on traditional channels, such as BBC 1 or ITV, but not when they’re shown on online video services such as iPlayer, Now TV or Netflix.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This is because when a show or film is moved online, the original broadcaster needs to provide a subtitle file for each device that the show will be viewed through – for example:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>set-top boxes, such as a Sky Box</li>
  <li>computers, smartphones and tablets</li>
  <li>games consoles, such as an XBox</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Often, these files aren’t provided, meaning people who rely on subtitles to enjoy TV and film miss out. 4 in 10 people now say that online video services are their main way of watching TV and film, but people who are Deaf or have hearing loss often don’t have this option.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Less than 1% of all on-demand content includes BSL - either as sign presented content or with BSL in-vision.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we want to change</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">We want the government to force online video services in the UK to provide a minimum level of subtitled TV shows and films.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Thanks to our campaigners, we changed the law in 2017 so that the government can regulate online video services and require them to have a minimum level of subtitled content. But they’ve still not put this law into action.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The regulator, Ofcom, is in the process of consulting to decide how the law should work in practice, we’ll engage with them whilst they are doing that but then we will need your help to tell the Government to bring the regulations into effect as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="govuk-body>Under the proposed regulations on-demand broadcasters would need to make 5% on content accessible in BSL - we want to work with broadcasters and regulators to bring this into effect and ensure they engage with the BSL users to ensure they provide the most important content to the community.<p>

    A wifi doorbell.

  <p class="govuk-body-l"> Wifi doorbells let you know when someone is at the door by sending a notification to your smartphone or tablet.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">They work by connecting to the internet through your home Wi-Fi and they are set up and controlled from an app on your smartphone or tablet.</p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who they're suitable for</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">People who find it difficult to hear the door in other parts of their home.</p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How they work</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Wi-Fi doorbells often have more features than traditional wired or wireless doorbells and door chimes. They may have a camera built into the door push so that you can see who is at the door on your smartphone or tablet.
</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Most have an intercom feature so that you can talk to the person at the door (and they can hear you). Some have a motion sensor to let you know when someone is at the door, even if they haven’t rung the bell.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Some Wi-Fi doorbells have separate Wi-Fi connected chimes (usually sold as an optional extra). They plug into a mains wall socket and you can have as many as you need. They provide a chime sound in addition to the notification on your smartphone or tablet.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">When using any device that connects to the internet (whether a Wi-Fi doorbell, smartphone, tablet or computer), make sure you know how to stay safe from hackers and protect your personal details.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Tips for staying safe online</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Have a unique password for each online account and make it as strong as possible, with a mix of lower- and upper-case letters, numbers and special characters such as # _ *.</li>
  <li>Make sure your Wi-Fi is secure – only give your Wi-Fi password to those you trust (the Wi-Fi signal in your home travels very short distances – but your neighbours next door or across the road may still pick it up).</li>
  <li>Keep your software (for example, your apps) updated. This way, you’ll have the latest security protection on your device. In many cases, apps associated with devices will notify you if a software upgrade is needed, or do it automatically.</li>
